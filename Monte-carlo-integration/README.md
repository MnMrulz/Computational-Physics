# Monte Carlo Integration

This folder contains implementations of Monte Carlo integration methods used to evaluate definite integrals through random sampling.

The methods are applied to simple test functions to illustrate statistical convergence, error scaling, and the advantages of stochastic techniques in high-dimensional problems commonly encountered in physics.
