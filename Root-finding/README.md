# Root Finding Methods

This folder contains implementations of standard root-finding algorithms widely used in computational physics.

The methods are applied to a transcendental test equation to compare convergence behavior, numerical stability, and sensitivity to initial conditions. Robust methods such as bisection are contrasted with faster but more sensitive approaches like Newton–Raphson and the secant method.
