# Computational Physics Kit

This repository contains implementations of fundamental numerical methods commonly used in computational and theoretical physics. My focus is on clarity, physical relevance, and reproducibility rather than software optimization(maybe a little?).
The codes in this repository are intended to demonstrate how core physical problems can be approached computationally using well-established numerical techniques.

## Contents

### Numerical Integration
- Trapezoidal rule
- Simpson’s rule
- Convergence and error analysis

### Root Finding
- Bisection method
- Newton–Raphson method

### Ordinary Differential Equation Solvers
- Euler method
- Fourth-order Runge–Kutta (RK4)

### Linear Algebra
- Eigenvalue and eigenvector computation

### Monte Carlo Methods
- Monte Carlo integration


## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib


## Motivation

This repository was developed as part of my preparation for research-oriented internships and graduate-level studies in physics, with an emphasis on building physical intuition through numerical experimentation.


## Notes
- Each script is self-contained and includes example usage.
- Codes prioritize readability and physical interpretation.
- Further extensions include applications to quantum mechanics, solid-state physics, and statistical mechanics.
