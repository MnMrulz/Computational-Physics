# Eigenvalue Problems in Physics

This folder contains numerical implementations of eigenvalue problems that arise naturally in quantum mechanics and other areas of physics.

Differential operators are discretized using finite-difference methods to construct matrix representations, and the resulting eigenvalue equations are solved numerically. The solutions are compared with known analytical results to demonstrate accuracy and physical consistency.
